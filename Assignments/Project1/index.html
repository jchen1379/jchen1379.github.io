		<p><b><i>Iceland</i></b> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are
		offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

					<h3>Northern Lights in Iceland</h3>
					<p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's
					namesake-namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round
					and takes place mainly on the Solheimajokull and Svinafellsjokull glaciers in the south
					of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reyljavik (and Skaftafell).

					<h3>Ice climbing & hiking on glaciers</h3>
					<p>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora,
					and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to April,
					Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.<br>
					The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural
					phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in
					the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.
