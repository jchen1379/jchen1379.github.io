				<i>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis</i>, or northern lights, begin high in the
				Earth’s atmosphere——at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles——when
				charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth’s magnetic
				field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.

				In the polar latitudes, auroras can appears on any dark night. Long winter
				nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March
				and September, the Earth’s magnetic field lets more solar particles interact
				with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in
				September, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the
				dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.
